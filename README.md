# Support for optional catch binding in Acorn

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-optional-catch-binding.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-optional-catch-binding)

Since optional catch bindings are part of ECMAScript 2019, acorn now supports it out of the box. Just make sure that you use acorn >= 5.6.0 and set ecmaVersion >= 10. This plugin is deprecated.
